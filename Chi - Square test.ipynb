    "# Chi Square test\n",
    "\n",
    "  Chi Square test is a non parametric statistical test to identify whether there is a significant difference between the distribution of expected and observed values. This test is used in feature selection for machine learning. This can be used to see how significant a feature in predicting the dependent variable.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In this test we will perform Chi Square test to see whether a given coin is biased or not.\n",

    "* **Null Hypothesis (H0): The Coin is unbiased.**\n",
    "* **Alternate Hypothesis (H1) : The coin may be biased.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we throw the coin for 30 times, we will expect 15 heads and 15 tails. If we get 16 heads and 14 tails, we are sure that it is by chance and with that alone we cannot say the coin is unbiased! What if we have 18 heads and 12 tails? Is it by chance? We need a metrics to find it. This is where we are in need of Chi square test.\n",
